[---- PERMISSIONS: -----]
-If you want to take my ROBLOX Crypt UI from my script, please credit BOTH me and Spookay. Spookay for the original, and me for the roblox UI. Or if you're just re-making the Crypt UI by not even glaring for a nanosecond on my UI, you can credit only Spookay at this point.
-You are allowed to make a video promoting my script.
-You are NOT allowed to de-obfuscate or crack this script.
If you don't agree with the ToS, please get rid of the script by deleting any copies you have.

NOTE: ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THE SCRIPT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY. ANY MALICIOUS OR ILLEGAL STUFF YOU DO WITH CRYPT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
